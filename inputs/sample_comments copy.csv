Switch 2 backwards compatibility is literally all I need to be a Day 1 buyer. Please Nintendo.
Just finished Echoes of Wisdom and it’s a total masterpiece. Best 2D Zelda in a decade.
The leaks about the 8-inch screen for the next console sound perfect for my aging eyes lol.
Metroid Prime 4 trailer actually looks insane. It was worth the 7-year wait.
Super Mario Wonder is pure joy. Nintendo still has that magic nobody else can touch.
I’m so glad I waited for the Switch 2 instead of jumping on the Steam Deck hype train.
The new Mario Kart DLC tracks are actually high quality. Totally worth the $25.
Hollow Knight: Silksong on Switch 2 is going to be the ultimate handheld experience.
Nintendo’s first-party lineup this year is basically carrying the whole gaming industry.
Switch 2 being able to hit 4K when docked is a dream come true for my OLED TV.
Another year, another Joy-Con drift issue. When will they stop using this cheap plastic?
I'm sick of these $60 ports of games I already played 15 years ago on the GameCube.
The Switch 2 is probably going to be underpowered compared to the PS5 anyway. What’s the point?
Still no folder support or custom themes? The Switch UI is so boring and clinical.
Pokemon Scarlet/Violet still runs like a PowerPoint presentation. It’s embarrassing for a billion-dollar franchise.
I’m not buying a Switch 2 if it’s just another 'iterative' update. We need real innovation.
The eShop is a laggy mess filled with shovelware. It’s impossible to find actual good games anymore.
Nintendo's online service is a total joke compared to what you get with Game Pass.
Waiting 7 years for any news on Metroid is just disrespectful to the core fanbase.
Why is Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom still $70? It’s been out forever and the price won't budge.
Oh boy, I can't wait for the Switch 2 to finally catch up to 2017 hardware specs in 2026.
Truly a 'pro' move by Nintendo to sell us a cardboard box for $80. Absolute innovators!
I love how Nintendo keeps my wallet safe by releasing literally nothing for 6 months at a time.
30 FPS in 2026? Stop it Nintendo, you're spoiling us with all this raw power.
Can't wait for the Switch 2 to launch with three whole games. What a feast!
The name 'Switch 2' is so creative. I bet they spent millions in R&D coming up with that one.
I'm so glad Nintendo cares about my nostalgia so much they refuse to ever lower prices on 7-year-old games.
Wow, a new Mario Party with the exact same boards from the N64? Groundbreaking stuff here.
Nintendo Online adding one N64 game every 3 months is peak efficiency. Keep up the hard work guys.
I’m sure the Switch 2 joycons definitely won’t drift this time. Just like they 'fixed' it the last five times.
